"""Numerical Solution
=====================
I changed sth

Now that we have an analytic solution, we can use the stochastic variational
method to get a numerical estimate and check whether it matches what we expect.

The idea of stochastic methods is that it uses some sort of randomness.  In
this instance, we want to construct a basis of Gaussian functions, but have no
good way of determining whether a Gaussian function is a good candidate without
doing the full calculation.  Because of this, we might as well just try a
number of random Gaussian functions and only keep the best ones to build the
basis.

    # WHAT ARE r0 and v0

    The system has some parameters (such as `r0` and `v0` which determine the
    trapping term) which are used throughout.  Although they are constant for a
    particular system, they in general can change between different systems and
    thus cannot be hardcoded.  This means that we would have to pass `r0` and
    `v0` into all the different functions all the time which quickly becomes
    cumbersome.  Similarly, we will sometimes want to have access to the S and
    H matrices, but it is also cumbersome having to specify them multiple
    times.

    For this reason, we create a class and store `r0` and `v0` inside the
    class.  Functions within the class, which are called methods, behave in
    much the same way except that they always take one extra argument at the
    start called `self`.  This `self` argument is special and allows for `r0`
    and `v0` to be accessed through `self.r0` and `self.v0`.

    Because of this special `self` argument, the declaration a method is:

    ```
    def foo(self, x, y):
        # ...
    ```

    and a call to the function within the class is done through `self.foo(x,
    y)`.

    Ultimately, the class will need to be created with definite values which is
    done through:

    ```
    system = System(r0=5, v0=10)
    ```raise NotImplementedError()

    With this instance of the class, the variables within the class and methods
    of the class can be accessed as follows:

    system.foo(x ,y)
